    <h2>Family</h2>
    <p>There are a total of four benevolences in the family. His father works in the information industry, his mother works as a full-time housekeeper, and his sister is in middle school.
      Dad is a logical person in doing things. On the contrary, mothers are sometimes more emotional. Other mothers in the family will read Dad, and our mothers are often read by Dad.
      My sister likes painting very much. She is now studying in the art class of the High School Affiliated to Normal University, which is quite excellent.
